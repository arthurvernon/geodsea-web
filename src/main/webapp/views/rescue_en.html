    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        Search and rescue operations (SRO) can utilise Geo d'Sea to track boating
        activity within their area of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Journeys may be registered, updated and closed out by the SRO using the the Rescue portal. When boats
        are overdue, the portal will alert the SRO.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, skippers may keep the SRO informed by using one of the available mobile applications.
        These can be downloaded from the iTunes or Google App store.
    </p>

                    Setup of an SRO entails:
                <ol>
                    <li>User registration</li>
                    <li>Organisation registration</li>
                    <li>Application by the organisation to perform the search and rescue role</li>
                    <li>Approval by the relevant authority for the organisation to perform the search and rescue
                        role
                    </li>
                    <li>Addition of members to the organisation</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <h4>User Registration</h4>

                <div ng-if="authenticated">
                    <p>
                        You are already registered. Others within the SRO may need to do the same.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div ng-hide="authenticated">
                    <p>
                        Before you can register a SRO, you must first be a registered user of Geo d'Sea.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you are not already registered, then go to the <a href="#/register/user">user
                        registration page</a>. Upon
                        completing the form, an email will be sent to the email address you specified. In it will be
                        a link that you
                        need to click on to complete your registration process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        User registration is free.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To complete the rest of the registration process, <a href="#/login">log onto the system</a>
                        and complete
                        the remainder of the steps.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Organisation Registration</h4>

                <p>
                    A SRO must first define the organisation before it can establish the search and rescue role.
                    To do this, visit the <a href="#/register/organisation">organisation
                    registration</a> page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The user who registered the organisation is automatically added as a member of that
                    organisation.
                </p>

                <h4>Adding Search and Rescue Role</h4>

                <p>
                    Geo d'Sea recognizes a number of different roles for organisations. One of those roles is search
                    and rescue.
                    Another role is that of the authority that oversees SROs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Prior to an SRO role being recognised, the relevant authority must approve the information
                    supplied by the SRO.
                </p>

            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Initial Setup">
                <p>The important aspects of setting up this role are as follows.</p>

                <h5>Area of Operations:</h5>

                <p>
                    This is the region over which the SAR assumes responsibility for boating.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a skipper uses the mobile app to start this journey, the system will then report this plan
                    to the SROs
                    who have indicated a primary responsibility for that region.
                </p>

                <h5>Contact Information:</h5>

                <p>
                    Geo d'Sea maintains important contact information on behalf of SROs and provides this
                    information to users via the mobile application. This includes the radio call sign and a telephone
                    number that the SRO can be reached on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of the relevant Sea Rescue Authority, the organisation's primary point of contact should
                    also be defined.
                </p>
                <h5>Location Update Preference:</h5>

                <p>
                    By default, boats will only inform the SRO of their departure and completion of their journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SRO may request that boats, departing from their Area of Operation, provide location reports.
                    Skippers may agree to report their location as requested, they may vary the request in order to
                    conserve resources or they may refuse to report their location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application will then attempt comply with the skipper's conditions and provide reports to the SRO.
                    This is of course subject to the skipper having the application running and the phone's resource
                    constraints, e.g. battery, memory, GPS and network signal.
                </p>

            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Tracking">

                <p> SRO Local search and rescue organisations
                    maintain records of boating activities originating from within their area of interest. They then maintain a
                    watch on their area or interest using maps and status displaystracked.</p>

                <p>SARs can use <a href="#/sample">Geo Tracker Sea Rescue Map</a>
                    to view active boats in their area of interest.</p>

                <p>Traditionally this information was maintained in a log, updated when a skipper radioed in his intentions and
                    later on again when the skipper returned. This information can now be maintained within Geo d'Sea.
                </p>

                <p>Skippers who use the BoatTrack&reg; application will input this information directly, reducing the burden on
                    members to record details.</p>

                <p>Rescue organisations are alerted to cases where a boat fails to report in by the planned return time.</p>

            </accordion-group>
            <accordion-group heading="Maintaining Information">

                <p>When a club first registers to use GeoDsea, the details of the club are entered including the radio callsign and
                    other contact details for the club. So that the system can ascertain which boats should be monitored, the area
                    of operations is defined using a map. An example of the tool you can use for this purpose is shown <a
                            href="/geodsea/WEB-INF/views/demo/map2.html" th:href="@{/demo/map2}">here</a>. You need to be registered
                    with GeoDSea to view this.</p>

                <p>Rescue organisation can define and publish the location of natural and man-made items such as hazards, channel
                    markers and boat launching ramps. Once published, this information can be used by skippers. For example, a
                    skipper using GeoDSea can see and enter his current location as &quot;Hillarys Marina Boat Ramp&quot; as opposed
                    to a geographic coordinate.<br/>
                    Also within an area of interest, the organisation has the ability to vet and publish (make public) or discard
                    information that others wish to make public.</p>

                <h3>Using Information</h3>

                <p>When a boat reports a position within a certain distance of an object then the system can raise an alert to the
                    skipper. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An exclusion zone may be defined around a sanctuary.</li>
                    <li>A 50 metre radius around a submerged object.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sending Alerts</h3>

                <p>BoatPortÂ® provides a facility to send an alert to selected or all active boats within the organisation's area of
                    interest. If required, an acknowledgement can be requested.</p>

                <h2>Monitoring</h2>

                <p>By enabling real-time reporting, others can track your location. This is ideal for:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Event organisers wanting a low-cost solution for tracking vessels, e.g. a sailing regatta to plot yacht
                        locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Friends and family who want some assurance of your location without being seen to be prying.</li>
                </ul>
